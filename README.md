# Alliance of Genome Resources Prototype
An initial prototype for the web portal of the Alliance of Genome
Resources.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've installed [pip][1] and [virtualenv][2] and [nodejs][3].

## Getting started
```bash
$ make build
$ make run
```

To run tests

```bash
$ make tests
```

## Development Environment Pro Tips
Assets are compiled using [webpack][4]. 
To enable [hot module replacement][5] in your development environment,
run `npm start` while the dev server is running and refresh the page.
Subsequent JavaScript changes will go to your browser as a "hot
update" without refreshing.

You can run JavaScript unit tests automatically on each file change by
running `npm run test:watch`.

JavaScript coding style is enforced with [ESLint][6].
The rules are configured in the .eslintrc file.
